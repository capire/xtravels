# Skill: Flight Booking

## When to Use

- User wants to search, book, or cancel a flight
- User mentions departure/arrival cities or airport codes
- A trip plan needs concrete flight options

## Instructions

1. Always call `describe` on the flights MCP first to learn the schema. The Flights entity is a denormalized view — field names differ from naive guesses.
2. Resolve city names to airport codes by calling `query` against the `Airports` entity (e.g. "Paris" → CDG, ORY).
3. Call `query` against the `Flights` entity, filtered by departure/arrival airports and date.
4. Present options with airline, flight ID, time, and price.
5. When the user confirms, call `bookFlight` with `{ flight, date, passenger, seats }`.
6. To cancel an existing booking, call `cancelFlight` with the booking ID.

## Notes

- Do not invent airport codes — always verify them by querying the Airports entity.
- If a query fails with a schema error, re-read the output of `describe` and retry with the correct field names.
